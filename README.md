# **Behavioral Cloning** 

This project mainly focuses on mimicing humans' driving behaviors via neural network and simulating it into the Game.

**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of humans' driving behaviors. It was generated by three different cameras  (left, mid, right) embedded in the font of the car.
* Construct a neural network in keras in order to solve the regression problem, which is by training the network to predict how much of the angle the car should shift.
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set.
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road.

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model.
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode.
* model.hdf5 containing a trained convolution neural network.
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results.

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the best weights of my convolution neural network. The file contains comments to show how each function works. And I have all functions compacted in the model.py.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

I was inspired by the paper [End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316) from NVIDIA. And also I have modified the activation functions into 'RELU' instead of 'ELU'. 

My model has total nine layers. The first five layers are all convolutional layers and the rest of the four are fully-connected layers. Among the convolutional layers, the first three are convolved by 5x5 filters, and the other two are convolved by 3x3 filters. The number of filters are 24, 36, 48, 64, 64 respectively (model.py lines 99-103).

The other four fully-connected layers have their sizes 100, 50, 10, 1 respectively (model.py lines 105-108).

And the difference between my network and network in the paper is the activation functions. I changed activations function of all convolutional layers (model.py lines 99-103).

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model



#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 25).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road ... 

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to ...

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the ... I thought this model might be appropriate because ...

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that ...

Then I ... 

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I ....

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...

Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image2]

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to .... These images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :

![alt text][image5]

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image6]
![alt text][image7]

Etc ....

After the collection process, I had X number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by ...


I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put Y% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was Z as evidenced by ... I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
